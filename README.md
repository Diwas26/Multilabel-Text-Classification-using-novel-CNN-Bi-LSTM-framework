# Multilabel-Text-Classification-using-novel-CNN-Bi-LSTM-framework
Text classification is a modelling approach where we have series of sequences as input to predict the class for the particular sequence. This predictive modelling approach tends to pose a challenge in a way that the input sequences that go as inputs do not have a constant length. This invariable length of the sequences accounts for very large vocabulary size and hence it usually requires model to learn long term contexts. Here we propose a framework that is capable of classifying the text into its various labels it belongs to. The CNN is used as feature extractor and Bi-LSTM as seq2seq learner to get us the desired output.
